# Promptcorn 🍿

Promptcorn is a graph-native movie discovery engine for

🇺🇸 US films (dominant consumption)
🇪🇸 Spanish films (cultural relevance)
🌍 selected international prestige cinema

Taste starts with curation, not ML.

## Core principles

- Neo4j is the source of truth
- Graph relationships first, embeddings second
- LLMs explain decisions, they do not make them
- Every recommendation must be debuggable
